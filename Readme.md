# Sentiment Analysis Chatbot

## Description

The Sentiment Analysis Chatbot is a web application that utilizes the OpenAI API and the GPT model for analyzing the sentiment of text input provided by users. This project leverages prompt engineering techniques, Python, and the Streamlit library to create a user-friendly interface for sentiment analysis.

## Features / Modules
The web app offers the following features:
1. **Sentiment Analysis**: Given user-provided text, the chatbot determines whether the sentiment is positive or negative.
2. **Sentiment Score**: The chatbot assigns a sentiment score ranging from 1 to 10, providing a quantitative measure of sentiment intensity.
3. **User Mood**: Based on the sentiment analysis results, the chatbot estimates the user's mood, making the interaction more engaging.


## Project Status
Completed
